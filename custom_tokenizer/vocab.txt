hello howdy how are you my names is mohsina 
i made this custom tokenizer. it will learn from this text and can encode and decode it
A tokenizer is an essential part of processing text for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It takes raw input text and splits it into smaller parts called tokens, which can be words, characters, or subwords depending on how the tokenizer is designed. This step helps convert human-readable text into a structured format that can be handled by machine learning models. Tokenization often includes preprocessing steps such as converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling special characters. Many tokenizers also add special tokens like <START>, <END>, and <UNK> to mark the beginning and end of sequences or unknown words. Advanced methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece break uncommon words into smaller subword units so that models can still understand them. Building a custom tokenizer allows control over the vocabulary size, token mapping, and handling of rare words, which can improve both the accuracy and efficiency of NLP models.
